# Music is Not Content — Manifesto Outline (Revised)

## Section 1: The Job That Isn't the Job

- Musicians now spend more time marketing than making music
- The work has become: running social media, pitching playlists, learning platform trends, creating "content"
- You've become a content creator who happens to make music, not a musician who exists online
- This isn't a personal failing—the platforms are designed this way
- Platforms need endless content to keep users engaged; your song is inventory
- The craft becomes the side project; promotion becomes the main job

## Section 2: The Economics of Devaluation

- Spotify's streamshare model: pool all revenue, divide by total plays
- More music uploaded = smaller slice for everyone
- 2024: Spotify paid $10 billion to music industry
- 70-75% flows to Big Three labels (Universal, Sony, Warner)
- Per-stream payout: $0.003 - $0.005 (that's $3,000-$5,000 per million plays)
- To earn $1,000 you need ~250,000 streams
- 2024 policy: tracks under 1,000 streams/year earn nothing
- This is the design, not a bug—platforms profit when content costs less
- Incentive structure: flood market with infinite supply until no individual track has leverage
- Music approaches free; margins improve for platforms
- The system is designed to devalue your work—and it's about to get worse (see Section 7)

## Section 3: The Algorithm Serves the Platform, Not You

- Algorithmic recommendation optimizes for platform engagement, not your taste
- It cares about keeping you on the app, not connecting you to artists
- Flattening effect: music sorted into "moods" and "vibes"
- Context disappears: where artist is from, their scene, who broke them, what they're responding to
- "Similar artists" without lineage; "fans also like" without community
- Artists rent audiences, don't build them
- No direct relationship with listeners—platform owns that relationship
- Algorithm giveth and taketh away; if it stops surfacing you, you vanish
- The deal: access to millions of listeners in exchange for connection to none of them

## Section 4: The Geography of Extraction

- US + Canada = 40% of global recorded music revenue
- US + Canada + Europe = 70%
- Three countries dominate (US, UK, Germany) while music cultures flourish everywhere
- Concentration isn't natural—it's built infrastructure: label HQs, licensing regimes, payment rails, playlist curation teams
- Money flows upward to music capitals (LA, NYC, London, Berlin)
- Artists outside US/EU banking systems excluded by payment rails
- Playlist curators concentrated in handful of cities
- Infrastructure assumes you're already in the center
- Extraction: value created locally, captured globally
- Scenes generate culture; corporations capture revenue

## Section 5: What Actually Works (The Microeconomics of Scenes)

- Underground music spreads through people, not algorithms
- How music actually moves: DJ plays track at right party, label head puts unknown on compilation, radio host champions sound early, blogger writes first review, promoter books first show
- Curators: humans doing work of filtering, contextualizing, championing
- They've built credibility over time, have skin in the game, accountable to community
- Tight-knit communities have their own microeconomies outside Spotify
- DJs booked for taste, labels get submissions from trust, promoters fill rooms from reputation
- Record shops as information hubs, venues as gathering points
- Money circulates within scene; reputation is the currency
- Engine of underground music: network of curators, venues, labels, artists who know and depend on each other
- No infrastructure for this online
- Curator can't get paid through any platform
- Scene is invisible—can't see it forming, can't see who's connected
- Trust network has no digital home

## Section 6: What Platforms Don't Understand About Creative Communities

- Scenes aren't audiences—they're cultures
- Not subscriber counts or follower graphs
- Shared aesthetics, internal hierarchies, ways of credentialing artists, physical gathering points, own economies
- Scenes have:
  - Gatekeepers who earn trust over time (not algorithms—people who stake reputation)
  - Sense of place (Berlin techno ≠ Detroit techno; geography shapes sound)
  - Visible networks (you can see who's connected, who came up together, who mentors whom)
  - Friction and curation (not everything gets in; boundaries are part of meaning)
- Platforms want frictionless, infinite scale
- Scenes are bounded, curated, specific
- Platform metrics (growth, engagement, time-on-app) hostile to what makes scenes work
- No major platform has social tooling for community formation
- Designed for broadcasting, not relating
- Artists push content out but can't connect through platform
- Not an oversight—reveals what platforms value: content throughput, engagement metrics, ad inventory
- Not: human relationships, community coherence, culture

## Section 7: The AI Moment

- Everyone's worried about AI—they should be
- The threat isn't "AI will make music"—it's that platforms are incentivized to replace you
- The devaluation strategy (Section 2) reaches its logical endpoint with AI
- If you can generate infinite content at near-zero cost, why pay human artists?
- Streaming already treats music as interchangeable commodity; AI makes the commodity cheaper
- The proof: labels sued AI companies in June 2024, now partnering with them
  - Warner settled with Suno (November 2025), announced partnership
  - Universal settled with Udio (October 2025), building licensed AI platform for 2026
  - Sony in talks with "ethically trained" AI companies
- The flood is here:
  - Deezer: 28% of uploads now AI-generated
  - Spotify removed 75 million AI tracks last year
- Major labels aren't fighting AI—they're positioning to own it
- Goal: generate infinite content, pay less for human artists, capture the upside
- What can't be automated:
  - The room where it happens (physical experience, other people, specific moment)
  - Trust built over years (curator-audience relationship, credibility from consistent taste)
  - Context of a scene (why track matters, who made it, where it came from, who co-signed)
  - Liveness and risk (possibility of failure, unpredictability, real-time tension)
  - Human relationship (artist-listener connection mediated by someone who cares)
- Competing on "content" = competing with machines
- Competing on human connection = defensible
- Platforms treating music as content build for AI to win
- We build for world where humans matter

## Section 8: A Different Vision — Decentralizing Music Culture

- Alternative to centralized extraction = distributed infrastructure
- What if local communities had own economies?
- What if money circulated locally instead of flowing to international corporations?
- What if curators could get paid for shaping taste?
- What if artist in Lagos paid directly by listener in Berlin, instantly, no US bank account needed?
- Vision: global but not homogenized, connected but not centralized
- Scenes sustain themselves economically
- Curators compensated for labor
- Infrastructure serves culture instead of extracting from it
- Not nostalgia for pre-digital—using digital infrastructure for different ends
- Payment rails that work globally without excluding global south
- Visible networks where you see scene forming
- Tools that support community coherence
- Platforms built for passive consumption won't evolve into this—business models depend on opposite
- Something else has to be built

## Section 9: What We're Building — Infrastructure for Subcults

- Subcult = social unit of culture creation
- Bigger than individual artist, more specific than genre tag
- Defined by shared aesthetics, mutual recognition, collective identity
- A subcult might be:
  - Local scene rooted in city/neighborhood
  - Diasporic community scattered globally but connected by sound
  - Genre-based collective crossing geographic boundaries
  - Cross-disciplinary group (music + visual art + writing + performance)
- "Scene" implies locality; subcult doesn't require it
- What defines it: coherence—group making culture together with shared references and mutual accountability
- SubCult is infrastructure for these collectives
- Not streaming platform, not social network—infrastructure
- Underlying systems that let subcults form, sustain, connect
- In practice:
  - Curator-owned communities: taste-shapers build communities and capture value
  - Direct artist payments: stablecoin rails (USDC on Base), instant, global, no 30% intermediary cut
  - Visible networks: see subcult forming, legibility not surveillance, feeling of being part of something
  - Small scale as success: 200 engaged listeners = success, reject growth-at-all-costs
  - Human curation over algorithms: discovery through trusted people, curator stakes reputation
- This is an experiment
- Proposing subcult as cultural unit
- Don't know exact shape—building with people who will use it

## Section 10: Who This Is For

**Curators:** DJ who runs party, label head who breaks artists, radio host, blogger, promoter—you do cultural work, deserve compensation. SubCult treats curation as labor, not just clout.

**Artists:** Should be making music, not marketing campaigns. Won't make you famous, but connects you to people who care—curators who champion, listeners who pay directly, scenes that claim you. Transparent economics, instant payments.

**Listeners:** Tired of algorithmic sameness. Want discovery that means something—music from trusted people, scenes to be part of, connection to artists. When you pay, money goes to artist. Not corporation, not black box.

**Anyone who cares about music culture:** Current trajectory = AI infinite content, platform infinite extraction, human musicians irrelevant. Another path exists—scenes sustain themselves, curators valued, infrastructure serves culture. We're trying to build it.

## Section 11: The Invitation

- SubCult is pre-launch
- Onboarding select curators to build subcults around taste and scenes
- If you're a curator with existing community (IRL or online)—want to talk
- If you're an artist wanting different relationship with listeners, not mediated by algorithms—building for you
- If you're a listener wanting to support directly, discovery that means something, part of scenes not just consuming—this is for you
- Don't have all answers
- Have: working product, set of principles, commitment to building with users
- Experiment is underway

**Music is not content**

**Scenes create culture**

**Curation is labor**

**Infrastructure should serve people who make music and people who love it**

**Let's build**
